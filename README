This is minimal MongoDB database editing web application I created for personal use when developing
projects using MongoDB.

It allows to list databases, collections, add and edit documents.

I'll probably add more features if I'll need it. It's no community project, I just shared it so
it may be useful for someone and also to have a shared code storage for this program. :)

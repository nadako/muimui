# muimui - minimal MongoDB editing app

This is minimal [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) database editing web application I created for personal use when
developing projects. It uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web mini-framework.

It allows to list and drop databases and collections, add and edit documents.

I'll probably add more features if I'll need it. It's no community project, I just shared it so
it may be useful for someone and also to have a shared code storage for this program. :)
